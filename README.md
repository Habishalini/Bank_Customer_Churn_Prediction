# Customer Churn Prediction

This project builds a machine learning system to predict customer churn for a retail bank.
The objective is to identify customers who are likely to leave so that proactive retention strategies can be applied.

## Project Overview
Customer churn directly affects revenue and long-term growth in the banking sector.
This project analyzes customer demographic and behavioral data and applies machine learning
and deep learning models to predict churn.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Bank Customer Churn Dataset
- Records: ~10,000 customers
- Target Variable: churn (1 = left, 0 = stayed)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## Evaluation
Models were evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
Random Forest and XGBoost produced the strongest performance.

## Project Files
- Jupyter Notebook: Bank_Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb
- Final Report (PDF): Customer_Churn_Prediction_Report.pdf

## Outcome
The project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow and provides actionable
business insights to support customer retention strategies.
